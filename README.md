# Obsidian
Example md files and the bat files I use for sync 

This md file works with dataviewer and tasks plugins to produce progress bars based on daily tasks that reoccur. It will also pull home and house related tasks from my Kanban file that I use as the main home for all my GTD things.

I use this for motivation and gamification of silly things like flossing and basic exercise. I hope you also find it useful. 

Any one who has used reoccuring tasks in Obsidian will know it can generate a lot of completed tasks, so I also include a bat file I use to 'clean up' the md file every once in a while by putting it into my GDrive and then running the bat file on my computer.
