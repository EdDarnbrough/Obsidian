Example md files and the bat files I use for sync 

This md file works with dataviewer and tasks plugins to produce progress bars based on daily tasks that reoccur. It will also pull home and house related tasks from my Kanban file that I use as the main home for all my GTD things.

I use this for motivation and gamification of silly things like flossing and basic exercise. I hope you also find it useful. 

Any one who has used reoccuring tasks in Obsidian will know it can generate a lot of completed tasks, so I also include a bat file I use to 'clean up' the md file every once in a while by putting it into my GDrive and then running the bat file on my computer. 

## Plugins I use
- Dataview obsidian://show-plugin?id=dataview

- Citations obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-citation-plugin
I use this with Mendeley by giving a .bib file as the database path and format BibLaTex. Mendeley auto generates the BibTex if on the Mendeley Desktop app (not the newer reference manager) under tools, select Opitions and the BibTex tab. Here Enable BibTex syncing and Create one file for the whole libaray. Note that Mendeley will only add papers to this document if you tell the app that all the details are correct. See the "Needs Review" catagory in the left hand panel, select the paper and then click 'details are correct'. I find all papers added via the chrome extension throw this error (and I am yet to find a way to batch confirm).
